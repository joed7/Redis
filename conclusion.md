##Conclusion

This concludes our presentation on Redis. Redis is a simple key-value store which provides efficient data-strucures. Unlike, relational databases, it is schema-less, and data-model is modelled using the redis data-structures like the [twitter exmaple](https://github.com/joed7/Redis/blob/master/twitter.md). Since Redis is just a collection of keys, it is very easy to scale horizontally with specific keys going to specific nodes. As per wikipedia, Redis has been ranked the #1 NoSQL (and #4 database) in User Satisfaction and Market Presence based on user reviews, the most popular NoSQL database in containers, and the #2 NoSQL among Top 50 Developer Tools & Services.
